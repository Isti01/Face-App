# Face Trace

Making this app was a lot of fun. I spent a lot of time with it, and I learned a lot not just about app making but also learned the basics of firebase.

In the firebase folder you can find the Cloud Functions code that I wrote for background tasks, like sending notifications and matching people.

[This is the machine learning model that I use](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832)
It was a huge struggle for me to get it up and running as a Cloud Function, but with some patience I managed to do it.
I had serious problems with TensorFlow and the solution was an different framework. I chose PyTorch.

This project is open source, you can find it on my GitHub [profile](https://github.com/Isti01/Face-App).
